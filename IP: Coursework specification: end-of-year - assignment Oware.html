assignment Oware</h1></center>



<h2>Outline</h2>

This work is due for electronic submission through duo by 17.00 on 
Friday 1 May 2015.  It contributes 40% to the final mark for this 
module.

<h2>Objectives</h2>

The objectives for this coursework are for you to demonstrate that you can:
<ul>
<li>Develop a complete application in Java;</li>
<li>Use console and file I/O;</li>
<li>Make programs robust through the use of exceptions and exception handling;</li>
</ul>



<h2>Scenario: The Game of Oware</h2>
<h4>Adapted from wikipedia
    under <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Text_of_Creative_Commons_Attribution-ShareAlike_3.0_Unported_License">Creative
	Commons Attribution ShareAlike</a>.</h4> The
    only substantive difference is in 'ending the game'.

Oware is an abstract strategy game among the bigger Mancala family of 
board games (or Pit and Pebbles Games) played all over the world with 
slight variations across different societies with regard to distribution
 area, number of players and strategy of play.



<h2>Rules (abapa variation)</h2>

The game requires an oware board and 48 seeds. An oware board has two 
straight rows of six pits, called "houses", and one large "score" house 
at either end. Each player controls the six houses on their side of the 
board, and the score house on their end. The game begins with four seeds
 in each of the twelve smaller houses.

<br>

The object of the game is to capture more seeds than one's
  opponent. Since the game has only 48 seeds, capturing 25 is
  sufficient to accomplish this. Since there is an even number of
  seeds, it is possible for the game to end in a draw, where each
  player has captured 24. 



<h2>Sowing</h2>
Players take turns moving the seeds. On a turn, a player chooses
  one of the six houses under their control. The player removes all
  seeds from that house, and distributes them, dropping one in each
  house counter-clockwise from this house, in a process called
  sowing. Seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses, nor
  into the house drawn from. That is, the starting house is left
  empty; if it contained 12 seeds, it is skipped, and the twelfth seed
  is placed in the next house. The diagram shows the result of sowing
  from house E. 



<h2>Capturing</h2>

After a turn, seeds may be captured from every consecutive house on
  the opponent's side whose seed total was brought to two or three on
  the player's current turn. They are placed in the player's scoring
  house. If the last
  seed placed into an opponent's house brought the house's total to
  exactly two or three, all the seeds in that house are captured. If
  the previous-to-last seed also brought an opponent's house to two or
  three, these are captured as well, and so on until a house is
  reached which does not contain two or three seeds. However, if a
  move would capture all of an opponent's seeds, the capture is
  forfeited since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the
  game, and the seeds are instead left on the board. In the diagram the lower player would capture all the seeds in houses e, d,
  and c but not b (as it has four seeds) or a (since it is not
  contiguous to the other captured houses).

<h2>Let the opponent play</h2>

The proscription against capturing all an opponent's seeds is
  related to a more general idea, that one ought to make a move that
  allows the opponent to continue playing. If an opponent's houses are
  all empty, the current player must make a move that gives the
  opponent seeds. If no such move is possible, the current player
  captures all seeds in his/her own territory, ending the game.



<h2>Ending the game</h2>
The game is over when one player has captured 25 or more seeds, or
  each player has taken 24 seeds (draw). If a cycle is made where a
  board state is repeated (regardless of which player's turn it is)
  then each player captures all the seeds on their side of the board
  and the game is over. If 100 consecutive moves are made without any
  seeds being captured by either player then the game is ended: the
  result is decided by the number of seeds in the score houses at that point.



<h2>Problem</h2>
A set of Java interfaces is provided: do not change any of the
  interfaces as your work will be compiled against the originals. You can also view the <a href="https://community.dur.ac.uk/s.p.bradley/teaching/IP/assignment_oware/doc/">javadoc for the interfaces</a>.
Static methods and constructors are specified in the class
  description where appropriate.
<h4>(40%) Write a two-player Oware game in Java with a textual
  user interface. You should write it for two human players and assume
  that the players will take turns. Do this by writing classes
  implementing each of
  the interfaces specified apart from GameManager. Provide a single
  implementation of the Player interface which works by asking the
  user (via the console) where to play. This game could be played
  through bluej by repeatedly calling the nextMove() method and
  checking getResult().</h4> 


<h4>(20%) Provide a full text-based user interface for a two-player Oware game.</h4>
<ul>
<li>All user input should be validated. Any invalid input
  (i.e. not as specified in the GameManager interface documentation)
  should result in an announcement to the user which includes
  (exactly) the words "Invalid input" along with an explanation of
  what would constitute a valid input.</li>
<li>If parameters to methods are not not correct then throw InvalidArgumentException
or IllegalStateException as appropriate 
unless a custom checked exception (e.g. InvalidHouseException) is
defined in the interface signature. </li>
<li>The program should be started through a main method which handles
  the progress of the whole game from identifying the players through
  to announcing the winner.</li>
<li>You do not need to implement the saveGame() and loadGame() or compare()
  functionality at this stage - those methods can throw the NotImplementedYetException.</li>
</ul>
<li>Details of the commands issued via the command line to set up the 
game are included in the interfaces provided, and a summary of how 
commands issued affect the GameManager are show in the diagram:
<br>
<img src="IP:%20Coursework%20specification:%20end-of-year%20-%20assignment%20Oware_files/OwareState.png">
</li>


<h4>(20%) Provide functionality for the current game state to be
  saved to and loaded from a text file by implementing the saveGame()
  and loadGame() methods from the GameManager interface.</h4>

<ul>
<li>On starting the program choose whether to start an existing game or load a saved game;</li>
<li>At any stage of a game a human player can choose to quit to the start menu, and then to exit with or without saving the game;</li>
<li>After loading a game play continues exactly where the game left off.</li>
</ul>



<h4>(10%) Write a deterministic algorithmic player that a human can play against.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Both the human and computer players should implement the Player
  interface.</li>
<li>Computer players only have one second to take their
  turn, otherwise they forfeit the game.</li>
<li>Care should be taken that a computer players cannot cheat by altering the game state.</li>
<li>At the start of the game the user should be able to choose
  which of the players are human and which are computer
  players.</li>
<li>Make sure that the compare() functionality is implemented at this stage to allow comparison of computer players.</li>
</ul>



<h4>(10%) Optimise computer player performance.</h4>
<ul>
<li>Performance is judged by how well your computer player performs
  against other computer players submitted.</li>
<li>Up to 10% will be awarded competitively based on the
  relative performance. An instance of the GameManager implementation 
  will be used as a comparator to sort the submissions.</li>
</ul>



<h2>Plagiarism</h2>

You must not plagiarise your work. You may use program source code
from the provided course examples, or any other source BUT this usage
must be acknowledged in the comments of your submitted file. Automated
software tools will be used to detect cases of source code plagiarism
in this assignment exercise. Attempts to hide plagiarism
by simply changing comments/variable names will be
detected. Plagiarism is not fair on those who work hard on this
assignment without resorting to plagiarising the work of others. The
School will always seek to address any instances of plagiarism
following the rules set down by the University.  You should have been
made aware of the Durham University policy on plagiarism. Anyone
unclear on this must consult the course lecturer prior to submission
of this assignment.
